# Search-Algorithms

This is my project for Optimization and Regression course. The aim of this project is to implement Search algorithms from scratch. 
We implemented the Basic Local Search Aglorithm and Population Search Algorithm


# Problem Definition:
We found it hard to decide how many trip packages it should sell in case to maximize profit and customer
satisfaction. The company provides two trip packages, package A and package B. To maximize the profit, the manager advises that the price of package A is 2400 SR/Star and, package B is 2500 SR/Star.

This project is a collaborative effort with @KhadejaYahya
